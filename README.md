## Description
Super-duper fireworks with easy-to-use properties. 100% patches, no JavaScript. There are two examples which will help you create marvelous AR experiences. The best starter kit for New Years effects.

### Fireworks Selfie example
If you are a beginner, I recommend starting with this project. It will quickly show you how to use the Spark AR Fireworks Block. Once you learn the Block properties, you should try to check what is hidden inside of it.

### Fireworks World example
There are three unique types of Fireworks. Each of them is launched on the rocket. The ScreenTap spawns the rocket in the front of the user.

### With which version of Spark AR Studio should I open the project?
Always try to open the project with the up-to-date Spark AR Studio. But if you find it too buggy or you are unable to open it, then try the original version (Spark AR **v127.1**) used to create this project.

No, you don't need any license to use the project, except for any asset noted in the [Credits](#credits), and I don’t give any warranty for the project. But I reserve a right to forbid you using the project in case you blatantly break the [GOOD_DEED](https://ShivekXR.com/GoodDeed/) terms or scam unaware people.

Yes, as long as you don’t break the [GOOD_DEED](https://ShivekXR.com/GoodDeed/) terms or rights of any party. Please check the [Credits section](#credits).

It is not necessary, but advisable.

I wish, but sorry, I can’t promise. If you are looking for help, please join [the official Spark AR Community group on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/SparkARcommunity).
